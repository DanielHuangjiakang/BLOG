## Paper Reading Workflow Summary

> *Use this guide to structure your reading approach.*

1. **Read the Abstract** – understand the **problem**, **contribution**, and **effectiveness**.  
2. **Look at the Experiments** – focus on **figures**, **tables**, and whether the paper is reproducible.  
3. **Go through Introduction** – understand **why** the authors pursued this and their **line of reasoning**.  
4. **Study the Methods/Approach** (especially if planning to reproduce). Start with **Python implementation** before getting stuck in derivations.  
5. **Review Related Work** – use **survey papers** + related work sections to understand the field.
