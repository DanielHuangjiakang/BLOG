| **Abstract**             | - Two problems conspire against the state-of-art approaches in parallel query execution. <br> - Present the *morsel-driven* query execution framework.                        | - Morsel driven: small fragemnets of input data("morsels") <br> - Adjust resources *dynamically* <br> -The plan can *elastically change during the query execution* |
